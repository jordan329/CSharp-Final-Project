DESCRIPTION FOR FRONTEND

This application is a c# frontend to a dotnet core backend that I wrote (which I will also include).
this application is for viewing information supplied by google maps about pizza places.

Simply type a zipcode into the textbox labeled "zip code" and press the "search zip" button,
and the application will make a get request to the API.

The API sends back JSON which is used to populate the "pizza place list" listbox.
Each item has a name and placeID property.

Once you click on an option more details are displayed based on a second get request sent
to the API which contains a placeID.
That placeID is then used to send back more JSON which gives more details
about the specific pizza place selected in the "pizza place list" listbox.

By clicking "Save Details" you can save the currently selected pizza places details in a .txt file.

I relied heavily on Newtonsoft.Json, Newtonsoft.Json.Linq to traverse the JSON sent by my api and use
the information sent to the application effectively

DESCRIPTION FOR BACKEND

This API is a c# dotnet core backend for a few applications I've coded over the course of the semester.

It has a PlacesController which uses a PlacesCaller class which uses System.Net.Http to send
an asynchronous api call (get request with zipcode)to google places api
and returns that JSON to an application that makes a request to my API.

It has a DetailsController which uses a DetailsCaller classwhich uses System.Net.Http to send
an asynchronous api call to google places api (get request with placeID)to google places api
and returns that JSON to an application that makes a request to my API.
